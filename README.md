# Building modular Single Page Web Applications without Frameworks

With the current churn of ever more JavaScript frameworks and libraries this talk explores the art of 
using modern JavaScript programming practices to build highly modular single page applications using 
dedicated libraries rather than one size fits all frameworks like AngularJS.

I will explore the feasibility of structuring the application into single cohesive modules, using a 
dedicated library for routing, rendering the Dom, testing and show the minimum amount of code needed 
to integrate the various libraries. 

This should give us a highly modular application who’s design and architecture can evolve with a 
project’s requirements.
